# Budgeting App in React/Express
I am currently building a budgeting app for personal use. 
Frontend is React and backend I am using Node.JS for backend and store data in a MongoDB database.


## Features
- Figures are updated automatically to the DB. So far there is a Budget, Savings, Transactions, and Auto Transactions.
- Savings will "roll over" to the next pay period automatically so they build up over time.
- Plan to add D3 data visuals.

## Dependencies
- react
- nodejs
