# Budgeting App in React/Express
I am currently building a budgeting app for personal use. 
Frontend is React and backend I am using Node.JS for backend and store data in a MongoDB database.


## Features
- Figures are updated automatically to the DB. So far there is a Budget, Savings, Transactions, and Auto Transactions.
- Savings will "roll over" to the next pay period automatically so they build up over time.
- Plan to add D3 data visuals.

## Dependencies
- react
- nodejs

## Setup
1. Clone this project locally.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Change the MongoDB env secrets to your setup.
4. Change the login code env to your preference. (inside the server.js file)
5. Run `npm run build`.
6. Finally, run `npm start`.
